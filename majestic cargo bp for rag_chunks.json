    "title": "INDUSTRY OVERVIEW",
    "content": "The global air cargo industry in 2025 is undergoing a strategic transformation, driven by e-commerce acceleration, perishables demand, and the need for resilient, tech-enabled logistics infrastructure. Air cargo volumes are projected to reach 80 million tonnes, marking a 5.8% year-over-year growth, with revenues expected to hit $157 billion globally (New Bloom Solutions, “Colombia Keeps the U.S. Floral Industry Blooming: Why 80% of America’s Flowers Start Here,” New Bloom Solutions, accessed September 11, 2025.). Latin America and the Caribbean are leading this surge, posting a 12.5% YoY increase in international cargo traffic, driven by perishables, nearshoring, and regional trade realignment (International Air Transport Association (IATA), “Air Cargo Market Analysis – April 2025,” IATA, accessed September 16, 2025. https://www.iata.org/en/iata-repository/publications/economic-reports/air-cargo-market-analysis-april-2025).\nMajestic Air Cargo enters this landscape with a dual-market focus: anchoring operations in Colombia’s robust internal market while leveraging corridor-level agility to expand across the Americas. Colombia alone handles over 580,000 tons of air cargo annually, with perishables, especially fresh-cut flowers, accounting for 90% of outbound volume (Air Cargo Week, “Avianca Cargo Becomes Top Flower Carrier from Colombia to the US,” Air Cargo Week, accessed September 16, 2025. https://aircargoweek.com/avianca-cargo-becomes-top-flower-carrier-from-colombia-to-the-us). This internal demand is amplified by FRESH-24’s projected $1.2B in annual throughput, creating a stable, high-frequency baseline for Majestic’s initial deployment.\nExternally, the rise of cross-border e-commerce, pharmaceutical cold chains, and time-sensitive industrial goods is reshaping air cargo priorities. E-commerce now drives 20% of global air cargo volumes (Air Cargo Week, “The E-Commerce Boom: Driving Demand for Air Cargo Services,” Air Cargo Week, accessed September 16, 2025. https://aircargoweek.com/the-e-commerce-boom-driving-demand-for-air-cargo-services), with Latin America among the fastest-growing regions due to high smartphone penetration and expanding fulfillment infrastructure. Perishable goods, including produce, seafood, and specialty exports like asparagus, have seen volume increases of over 21% in key corridors such as Lima–Madrid and Bogotá–Miami. These trends align directly with Majestic’s specialization in temperature-sensitive cargo and its integration with FRESH-24’s perishability scoring and simulation logic.\nTechnological convergence is redefining competitiveness. AI-driven demand forecasting, automated customs workflows, and real-time cargo orchestration are no longer optional, they’re foundational. Majestic Air Cargo leverages a shared intelligence layer with FRESH-24, enabling predictive routing, dynamic load optimization, and corridor-specific compliance automation. This not only reduces spoilage and delays but also positions Majestic as a logistics intelligence system rather than a conventional carrier.\nWith jet fuel costs down 21.2% YoY (International Air Transport Association (IATA), “Air Cargo Market Analysis – April 2025,” IATA, accessed September 16, 2025. https://www.iata.org/en/iata-repository/publications/economic-reports/air-cargo-market-analysis-april-2025), and capacity growth lagging behind demand, operators with dedicated fleets and corridor-level control, like Majestic, are poised to capture margin and market share.

    "content": "Latin America’s aviation landscape is dominated by a handful of incumbent carriers that have shaped regional connectivity, cargo flows, and consumer expectations over the past two decades. These airlines, LATAM, Avianca, Copa Airlines, Azul, Gol, Volaris, and Viva-Aerobus, represent both opportunities and constraint for new entrants like Majestic Air Cargo. While they offer scale, infrastructure, and brand recognition, they also suffer from legacy inefficiencies, fragmented cargo strategies, and limited perishables specialization. Understanding their operational models, market positioning, and strategic blind spots is essential to defining Majestic’s competitive edge.\nLATAM Airlines Group\nLATAM is the largest airline group in Latin America, operating across Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador. It holds a commanding 52% market share at São Paulo Guarulhos (GRU) and maintains dominant positions in Santiago and Lima. In 2024, LATAM operated 553,191 flights, with a 7% YoY increase in frequency, and served 694 routes, though this number declined slightly due to network optimization.\nIts fleet includes 35 narrowbody and 23 widebody aircraft, with an average age of 8.4 years, and no regional jets or turboprops. LATAM’s aircraft are optimized for long-haul and high-density routes but lack specialization in perishables or short-haul cargo.\nAvianca\nAvianca is Colombia’s flagship carrier and a regional powerhouse, operating 169 routes to 82 destinations, including 43 domestic and 37 international routes. It holds a dominant position in Colombia, with 80 active routes and a strong presence in the U.S.–Latin America corridor, where it added 8,000 weekly seats in 2025.\nIts fleet includes 134 Airbus A320 family aircraft, 15 Boeing 787s, and 14 Airbus A330s, with an average fleet age of 7.2 years. Avianca’s widebody aircraft are used on premium transcontinental routes, while narrowbodies dominate regional operations.\nSchedules are robust, with daily frequencies on key U.S. routes like Miami–Bogotá and New York–Medellín, and 3–4x weekly service on secondary routes.\nDespite its strength in outbound perishables, especially flowers, Avianca’s corridor logic remains outbound-centric, with limited inbound optimization and perishables diversity. Majestic’s bidirectional perishables routing and simulation logic offer a clear advantage.\nCopa Airlines\nCopa Airlines operates from its Panama City hub, serving 88 destinations in 32 countries with 375+ daily flights. It holds a strategic position in short-haul connectivity across Central and South America, but lacks a dedicated freighter fleet.\nCopa’s fleet consists of 114 aircraft, primarily Boeing 737 MAX 8s, with an average age of 6.1 years. The uniform fleet supports operational efficiency but limits cargo flexibility, especially for perishables and oversized freight.\nCopa’s belly-only cargo model restricts perishables throughput and corridor adaptability.\nAzul Linhas Aéreas\nAzul is Brazil’s largest carrier by network coverage, serving 160+ destinations with 1,000 daily flights. It holds a 41.8% market share on domestic routes, with strong performance in underserved regional markets.\nAzul’s fleet includes 45 Embraer E2 jets, 22 Airbus A330neos, and multiple ATR turboprops, with an average fleet age of 6.7 years. This mix supports regional access and cold-chain logistics, though perishables handling remains secondary.\nGol Linhas Aéreas\nGol operates 74 destinations with a fleet of 139 Boeing 737s, including 7 freighters, and maintains hubs in São Paulo, Brasília, and Rio de Janeiro. It holds a 26.9% market share in Brazil, down from its peak, and is undergoing restructuring under Chapter 11.\nGol’s fleet includes 54 Boeing 737 MAX 8s, with an average age of 8.2 years, and 30 MAX 10s on order. Its all-737 strategy supports cost efficiency but limits perishables handling and corridor flexibility.\nVolaris & Viva-Aerobus\nThese Mexican ULCCs dominate domestic traffic, with Volaris holding 42% and Viva-Aerobus 36% of the market. Volaris operates 113 Airbus aircraft, 61% of which are NEO models, while Viva-Aerobus has 70 aircraft, including A320s and A321neos, with an average age of 6.9 years.\nSchedules are dense on domestic routes, with 3–5x daily frequencies between major cities, but international coverage remains limited.",

    "title": "Barriers to Market Entry in Latin American Air Cargo (2025)",
    "content": "While Latin America presents high-growth potential for air cargo, market entry is shaped by a complex web of regulatory, operational, and competitive constraints. These barriers vary by country but share common themes: limited slot availability at major hubs, restrictive bilateral agreements, and entrenched incumbent positioning.\nMajor airports like São Paulo (GRU), Mexico City (NLU), Bogotá (BOG), and Santiago (SCL) operate near capacity, with slot allocation tightly controlled by national aviation authorities. New entrants face challenges securing peak-hour slots, especially for freighter operations, which are deprioritized in favor of passenger traffic. Infrastructure constraints, such as limited cold-chain terminals and outdated cargo handling systems, further restrict operational flexibility.\nLatin America’s air transport liberalization remains fragmented. While some countries have embraced open skies (e.g., Chile, Panama), others maintain restrictive bilateral air service agreements that limit foreign carrier frequencies, cargo rights, and route access. For example, Brazil and Argentina require reciprocity clauses and often cap third/fourth freedom rights, complicating multi-stop corridor activation. These agreements can delay route launches and require diplomatic negotiation or strategic partnerships.\nCustoms procedures across the region are inconsistent, with varying clearance times, documentation requirements, and inspection protocols. In countries like Peru and Ecuador, collaborative models between cargo operators and customs (e.g., Talma’s integration with Peruvian authorities) have improved throughput, but such models are not yet widespread. Regulatory fragmentation increases compliance costs and reduces predictability, especially for perishables and pharma.\nIncumbent carriers such as LATAM, Avianca Cargo, and Copa Airlines benefit from preferential access to slots, legacy infrastructure, and long-standing government relationships. Their dominance in key hubs creates informal barriers to entry, including lobbying influence and priority in cargo terminal access. Additionally, their scale allows them to undercut pricing on high-volume lanes, making it difficult for new entrants to compete on cost alone.",

    "content": "Majestic Air Cargo enters the Latin American aviation and logistics market with a precision-first model designed to serve a captive, underserved segment: perishables producers, platform operators, and corridor-based trade systems. While incumbents dominate by volume, Majestic is engineered for strategic depth, activating modular corridors, optimizing freshness-sensitive cargo, and embedding simulation-driven resilience into every route. The opportunity is not just market share, it’s market orchestration.\nFRESH-24, Majestic’s sister company, is the primary user and strategic driver of corridor activation. As a perishables platform coordinating high-frequency trade between producers and buyers across the Americas, FRESH-24 demands a logistics backbone that guarantees freshness, predictability, and bidirectional flow. Existing carriers cannot meet these standards. Their models are outbound-centric, generalized, and reactive.\nMajestic fills this gap by offering perishables-first routing, ESG-compliant fleet logic, and real-time corridor orchestration. FRESH-24’s internal demand engine feeds directly into Majestic’s simulation layer, enabling dynamic routing based on perishables type, temperature sensitivity, and buyer urgency. This transforms logistics from a cost center into a strategic asset.\nMajestic Air Cargo is the logistics engine of FILPROC, Fully Integrated Production and Logistic Corridors, serving as the connective tissue between mapped production nodes and activated demand centers across the Americas. While FILPROC fuses production, logistics, and technology into a single intelligent infrastructure, Majestic is the carrier that operationalizes this intelligence in motion. It transforms FILPROC’s corridor logic into real-world routing, ensuring that perishables and high-value goods move with precision, speed, and strategic control.\nMajestic’s fleet is designed around perishables-first logic, optimized for temperature-sensitive cargo and synchronized with harvest-to-market cycles. Every route is modeled through FILPROC’s simulation engines, allowing Majestic to dynamically activate corridors based on real-time supply signals from farms, fisheries, and manufacturing hubs. This eliminates latency and replaces static scheduling with predictive orchestration.\nThrough FILPROC’s logistics synchronization layer, Majestic integrates cold-chain systems, bonded warehousing, customs pre-clearance, and multimodal handoffs into a unified routing protocol. Whether moving flowers from Bogotá, seafood from Kingston, or produce from Querétaro, Majestic ensures that every shipment is tracked, quality-assured, and ESG-compliant. Its modular routing logic allows corridors to be replicated rapidly across new geographies and product categories.\nOn the technology front, Majestic interfaces directly with FILPROC’s backbone, leveraging AI-driven production mapping, real-time orchestration, and dashboards to optimize every flight. It also powers the logistics layer for FRESH-24, enabling institutional buyers, auction platforms, and e-commerce channels to access live routing, traceability, and impact metrics.\nThe introduction of a cargo low-cost carrier (CLCC) in Latin America would represent a seismic shift in the region’s air logistics landscape. Currently, the market is dominated by legacy carriers with high fixed costs, rigid scheduling, and generalized service models that prioritize volume over precision. A CLCC, built around modular routing, lean operations, and perishables-first logic, would democratize access to air cargo, especially for small and mid-sized producers, regional platforms, and underserved corridors.\nBy stripping away legacy overhead and optimizing for short-haul, high-frequency routes, a CLCC could reduce cost-per-kilo by 20–35%, unlocking new demand from captive markets previously priced out of air transport. It would also introduce competitive pressure on incumbents, forcing them to rethink pricing, perishables handling, and corridor responsiveness. For platforms like FRESH-24, a CLCC offers direct control, real-time routing, and scalable access to secondary cities, transforming logistics from a bottleneck into a growth engine. In essence, the arrival of a cargo low-cost carrier wouldn’t just disrupt the market, it would expand it.",

    "content": "Administrative Structure\nMajestic Air Cargo’s administrative structure is built on a lean, high-performance framework that prioritizes real-time visibility, accountability, and operational clarity across all departments. At its core is a unified tech layer, combining proprietary systems and third-party platforms, to enable live tracking, automated workflows, and seamless data exchange. This infrastructure supports key operational axes including human resources management, compliance, traceability, and performance governance, ensuring that every process is auditable, responsive, and aligned with strategic objectives. By minimizing human error and maximizing process reliability, Majestic creates a logistics environment where decision-making is data-driven, and execution is frictionless.\nCustomer Service Model\nCustomer service model mirrors this operational philosophy, blending technology and human engagement to deliver premium support across all touchpoints. A third-party call center handles inbound inquiries with speed and professionalism, while commercial portfolio agents are empowered through integrated dashboards to resolve client needs proactively. Web-based channels with real-time chat, shipment tracking, and tailored response logic ensure that every customer interaction is transparent, efficient, and personalized. This multi-channel approach, underpinned by Majestic’s tech ecosystem, guarantees that service delivery is not only consistent, but strategically aligned with the company’s commitment to excellence and platform-driven logistics.\nLabor structure and compensation\nPay Rates and Scales: Crew pay rates will align with industry averages to attract and retain skilled personnel. For other roles, salary bands will be linked to the minimum wage yet set above market minimums to promote employee commitment and responsibility, laying the foundation for a positive workplace culture.\nBenefits: All employees will receive benefits as defined by internal policy, including performance-based bonuses tied to the achievement of KPIs, team accomplishments, and company financial results. A set percentage of net profit will be allocated annually for these benefits. Human Resources will also establish non-monetary incentives to further enhance the work environment.\nContracts and Employment Terms: All staff will hold direct contracts with Majestic Air Cargo. Salaries will be adjusted annually in line with the minimum wage indicator, ensuring equitable conditions and consistent benefit programs. The company is committed to a non-union labor structure, relying on competitive compensation and comprehensive benefits to promote employee satisfaction and retention.\nMaintenance\nMaintenance will be under third party contract until fleet size is enough to establish Majestic’s maintenance infrastructure:\nLine: daily, weekly and “A” checks will be performed by a certified FAA shop, will be supervised and audited by the company’s internal maintenance structure.\nAlso, a mechanic must be a part of the crew to be the primary link with the maintenance response system and ensure reliability and continuous airworthiness.\nHeavy checks will be performed with a certified MRO.\nFlight operations\nWill be performed under the requirements established under FAR 121, sufficient crews will be available to support the 24/7 operations with all safety standards.\nTraining also will be in accordance with the regulations and additional tools for skill development will be provided.\nFuel policies\nAs fuel represents more than 45% of the company’s cost structure, a fuel conservation program will be developed and established, all flight fuel consumption will be monitored and analyzed to prevent over burning or poor operation of the aircraft. This doesn’t represent any risk for the flight; all fuel quantities will be enough to fulfill the mission and will have a 10% extra fuel plus a minimum of an extra 1 hour of flight fuel.  Flight engineering ops will be monitoring and giving feedback in both directions with the crews to have reliable statistics that can provide information to make purchasing policies.\nA substantial difference in the fuel price between Colombia and the U.S. is a constant, so a tankering system will be established to monitor permanently the fuel prices in departure / destination airports to load the most amount of fuel within the payload, weight and balance and commercial requirements for the flight.\nTechnology (IT, AI, WEB Services)\nMajestic Air Cargo’s technology layer is the operational backbone of its perishables-first logistics model, designed to unify customer-facing interfaces, flight operations, administrative workflows, and financial governance into a single, integrated ecosystem. From the moment a customer initiates a reservation, whether through direct charter, indirect charter, or platform-based booking, the system activates a dynamic routing engine that aligns cargo requirements with available aircraft, corridor schedules, and perishables handling protocols. This front-end interface is seamlessly connected to Majestic’s flight operations module, which manages aircraft allocation, crew scheduling, route simulation, and cold-chain compliance in real time.\nAt the core of this architecture is a modular platform that synchronizes administrative tasks, including HR management, compliance tracking, and documentation, with flight and maintenance operations, ensuring that every component of the business operates under unified logic. Maintenance schedules are linked to aircraft utilization data and spare parts inventory, allowing predictive servicing and budget alignment. The system flags parts consumption against corridor profitability, enabling strategic decisions on fleet deployment and asset optimization. Safety and security protocols are embedded throughout the cargo lifecycle, with automated alerts for temperature deviations, customs anomalies, and route disruptions, ensuring traceability and integrity from origin to destination.\nFinancial operations are fully integrated into the platform, with a built-in payment gateway that supports multi-currency transactions, escrow logic for platform clients, and automated invoicing tied to cargo milestones. Budgeting tools correlate operational costs, fuel, crew, maintenance, and ground handling, with revenue streams from both direct and indirect charter models, providing real-time visibility into margin performance and corridor ROI. This holistic tech layer transforms Majestic from a traditional air cargo operator into a digitally orchestrated logistics engine, where every decision is data-driven, every process is traceable, and every shipment is part of a larger strategic flow.",

    "title": "FINANCIAL ANALYSIS",
    "content": "Revenue Streams\nDirect Charter\nThe Direct Charter product is designed for enterprise-level clients capable of securing a full round-trip aircraft originating from strategic hubs such as Rionegro. Under this model, the customer defines the cargo volume within aircraft payload limits, with Majestic providing end-to-end operational support, including perishables processing, cold chain integrity, security screening, aircraft loading/unloading, and all aeronautical and airport services.\nThis product is ideal for high-season perishables exports (e.g., floriculture, fresh produce) where timing, shelf-life, and market urgency demand dedicated lift capacity.\nPricing Model:\nBase Fare + Variable Fare + Ancillary Costs = Operational Cost\nOperational Cost × Profit Margin (15–20%) = Sale Price\nThe Direct Charter model within Majestic Air Cargo is structured into two distinct variants: Fixed Contract and Occasional Contract. The Fixed Contract is deployed in strategic partnership with Fresh24, positioning Majestic as its primary air logistics provider for perishables. This variant operates with lower profit margins, intentionally designed to enhance product competitiveness and ensure consistent corridor activation aligned with shelf-life and market urgency. In contrast, the Occasional Contract serves ad-hoc clients requiring dedicated lift capacity on a non-recurring basis. Due to the unpredictability of demand and routing complexity, this variant carries higher profit margins to offset forecasting challenges and operational risk, while still maintaining Majestic’s standards for cold chain integrity and service reliability.\nIndirect Charter – Payload Fractionalization via GSA Network\nThe Indirect Charter product serves mid-sized and SME exporters with consistent but fractional cargo needs. Flights are chartered round-trip by a General Sales Agent (GSA), who assumes commercial risk and resells payload capacity by kilogram to multiple clients. All operational services, cold chain control, cargo handling, and security, mirror those of the Direct Charter.\nThis model supports year-round perishables flow, balancing corridor occupancy and market accessibility.\nPricing Model:\nBase Fare + Variable Fare + Ancillary Costs = Operational Cost\nOperational Cost × Route Index × Profit Margin = Sale Price per kg\nThe Route Index adjusts pricing based on corridor length, airport fees, traffic density, and perishables sensitivity. It ensures competitive pricing while preserving margins and service quality.\nMajestic Air Cargo will establish its own dedicated General Sales Agent (GSA) to manage and commercialize the Indirect Charter flight model across its core corridor network. This internal GSA will be responsible for optimizing payload distribution, pricing per kilogram, and ensuring alignment with perishables demand signals from Fresh24. However, Majestic remains strategically open to collaborating with external GSAs in cases where routes fall outside its dedicated corridor structure or where mutual benefits, such as lower operational costs, superior infrastructure access, or enhanced efficiency metrics, justify external engagement. This hybrid approach ensures both control and flexibility, allowing Majestic to maximize aircraft occupancy, preserve service quality, and expand market reach without compromising its perishables-first logistics standard.\nValue-Added Services\nMajestic offers modular add-ons to enhance cargo integrity and traceability:\nTemporary Cold Storage – Buffer zones at origin/destination for perishables staging\nLive Cargo Tracking – Real-time visibility across air and ground segments",
